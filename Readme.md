"Aloo" means potato, and "tikki" means a small cutlet or croquette in Hindi-Urdu and Marathi. It is served hot along with a side of saunth, tamarind, and coriander-mint sauce, and sometimes dahi (yogurt) or chickpeas. The snack is a vegetarian alternative and an Indian equivalent of the hash brown.
